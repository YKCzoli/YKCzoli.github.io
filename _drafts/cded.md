Elevation data is key in our understanding of the terrain our societies are built on. They inform our national flood strategies, dictate our land use policies, and drive our workout apps. A comprehensive national Digitial Elevation Model can be used by all levels of government, large corporations, small start-ups, and students. It's a great investment to make at a national scale, as the one time data collection can benefit many, if provided under an open license.

The Canadian Digital Elevation Dataset is such a dataset. It is national, comprehensive, and available under an open license. There is a user interface on [geogratis](http://www.geogratis.gc.ca/site/eng/extraction) for download. The data is also available by [FTP](ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/cdem)!

This is great for a few reasons. First, you can get started quickly by looking at a DEM for a local area you are interested in through the [extraction tool](http://www.geogratis.gc.ca/site/eng/extraction). If you'd like to download all of the data you can do this through the FTP.

However, if you want to investigate the province of Ontario, or the City of Calgary, there is not a simple clean way to do this.

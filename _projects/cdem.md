### National Datasets

Elevation data is key in our understanding of the terrain our societies are built on. They inform our national flood strategies and dictate land use policies. A comprehensive national Digitial Elevation Model can be used by all levels of government, large corporations, small start-ups, and students. It's a great investment to make at a national level as the one time data collection can benefit many, if provided under an open license.

The Canadian Digital Elevation Model is such a dataset. It is national, comprehensive, and available under an open license. You can download tiles via user interface from [Remote Pixel](https://remotepixel.ca/projects/cded_leaflet.html){:target="_blank"}. The data is also available by [FTP](http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/elevation/cdem_mnec/){:target="_blank"}.

### Visualizing with Context

The dataset can also be used as a web map service. Without downloading and processing all of the data one can make a simple visualization with some context.

### Looking Forward

The elevation model is great, but has some short comings. As you can see in the map, if zooming in to see high levels of detail, the view becomes coarse. Luckily, there is a higher resolution model in the works. Readers can find more information on this in this great [GoGeomatics summary](https://gogeomatics.ca/ccmeos-elevation-data-revolution-has-begun-canadas-new-dem/){:target="_blank"}.

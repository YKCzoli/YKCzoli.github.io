<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Yuriy, a GIS developer at <a href="http://www.sparkgeo.com/">>sparkgeo</a>.</p>

<p>Professionally, I aim to work in industries that require me to negotiate aggressive learning curves. This has lead me to learn quite a bit about open source GIS, satellite imagery analysis, LiDAR workflows, catastrophe modeling, and most recently web app development.</p>

<p>More importantly, this philosophy has allowed me to meet some pretty cool folks/communities, and i'm pretty happy about that.</p>

### Consuming Content

[Postlight's](https://www.postlight.com/){:target="_blank"} content is terrific. [Track Changes](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/){:target="_blank"} has introduced me to public tech figures i never knew existed and tech culture insights i have yet to think of. Each newsletter is structured slightly differently which is a nuance i find myself appreciating every time i read their newsletter. Seriously: ["The medium is the message"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message){:target="_blank"}.

### Reading

I am wading through the Don Quixote. I wasn't expecting it to be funny, but damn its funny. I was expecting it to be long, and it is. The stories of misadventure make me feel better about my own [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome){:target="_blank"}, especially when i am [fighting windmills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilting_at_windmills){:target="_blank"}.

### This Site

This site will host my [content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_(media)){:target="_blank"}, whether said content includes my thoughts, ideas, or projects. They will most likely have some loose relation to [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system){:target="_blank"}, which is a subject that may include remote sensing, maps, design, code, python, open source tools, community, decision making, etc.
